# k-Means Algorithm

The k-Means algorithm is used for quantization or cluster analysis of data.
It commonly refers to the implementation proposed by Stuart P. LLoyd in his publication `Lloyd, Stuart. "Least squares quantization in PCM." IEEE transactions on information theory 28.2 (1982): 129-137`.
